# Adding VMs to the Fusion ESXi Lab
Once you have at least 1 host added to vSphere through the vCenter Server appliance using the Web Client, you can start adding some VMs.

For now we advise to follow [this documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-55238059-912E-411F-A0E9-A7A536972A91.html).
